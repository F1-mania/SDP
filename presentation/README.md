## Main Points to cover:

### Arduino
#### Why we use Arduino
- Advantages it gives
    - Faster/more responsive communication
    - Finer control over motors (?)

#### Challenges of implementing Arduino
    - Batteries
    - Motors burning out
- How we overcame them
    - New motor shield/driver chips

### Vision
#### Why we wrote from scratch
- Change in task
- Advantages this gives
    - Vision system is more task-specific
    - Can be better integrated with the whole system
    - Easier to extend

#### Look at interesting/important parts of the vision
- Calibration and Distortion Correction
- Tracking and Angle Detection

#### Challenges of implementing vision
- Distortion
- Colour calibration
- How we overcame them

### Planning
#### Look at interesting/important parts of the planning
- Planner
- Models
- Strategies

#### Challenges of planning
